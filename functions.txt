## Testing out simple function def syntax 
def add(x, y) = {		## Your basic function declaration
	x + y
}

let add(x, y) = x + y		## Same as above but without "{}" block
let add(x y) = x + y		## Can I remove the need for the comma (pattern matching)
let add(x: Int y: Int)		## How would it work with argument contexts/contracts

def add x y = x + y		## What's the meaning of "x","y" in terms of contracts
add 0 y = y			## This has to take a value and assign to x ???
add x 0 = x

let add = (x, y) => x + y	## This is going to be allowed regardless
				## The question is if this is all that's needed

let add = \x, y => x + y	## Lambda-calculus/Dust inspired syntax
let add \x, y = x + y		## Not sure how well it works here


## Testing out contracts
factorial (< 0) = 1
factorial n = n * factorial(n - 1)


## Testing out parametric stuff


## Testing out infix function def syntax (match/generic syntax is uncertain at this point)
data Option[T] = Some(val: T) | None
## Keyword is necessary because Some and None aren't types, but constructors
	## How to add implementations ???

## An function that doesn't follow variable rules is automatically infix
## Rust style definitions
def >>=(opt: Option, f: Function) = {
	opt .match {		## `.<name>` turns the function/etc into infix
		Some(val) => Some(f(val))
		None => None
	}
}

## Scala style definitions
def >>=(opt f) = match opt {
	Some(val) => Some(f(val))
	None => None
}

## Haskell style definitions
let >>= (Some(val), f) = Some(f val)
let >>= (None, _) = None

## No def context and function contract syntax, only lambda literals
let >>= = (opt f) => match opt {	## what if opt becomes a context
	Some(val) => Some(f val)	## this would turn f into an optional arg
	None => None
}

Some(3) >>= add(5)			## operators are infix by default (no '.' needed)
>>=(None, add(4))			## what if .>>= allowed this instead ???
Some(3) add(5) ..>>=			## what if '..' turned a function into postfix


## Argument context and contract
def foo(mut x: Int) = {
	x = x + 1
}

## Function casing (demonstrate with take, factorial, 
def take[T](n: Size, ts: T*) = match (n, ts) {
	(0, _) = Nil
	(_, Nil) = Nil
	(n, x:xs) = x : take(n - 1, xs)
}
