mod hello
use std:io:println

def main = () -> "Hello, World!".println

# Might change language to make this possible
#"Hello, World!".println

##
Could I lose the main and just have the println ???
    Maybe if I move to the event-loop, the non-function stuff, the "globals" will get evaluated in the setup phase
    And then main is the default entry-point for interactive execution
