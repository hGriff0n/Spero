Spero Language

Spero is a new compiled, statically typed language that I've taken to creating to learn more about modern type 
systems, the process of compilation, and more.


The Spero project also contains three sub-projects: speroc, Spark, and vs-spero

    speroc - Spero reference compiler. Unknown implementation language

    Spark - Spero build/dependency manager. Initial development will be done in Rust
    
    vs-spero - VS Code extension that adds Spero support
