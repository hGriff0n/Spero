Spero Language

Spero is a new compiled, statically typed language that I've taken to creating to learn more about modern type 
systems, the process of compilation, and more.


The Spero project also contains four sub-projects: speroc, spero-std, Spark, and vs-spero

    speroc - Spero reference compiler. Unknown implementation language
    spero-std - The implementation for the spero standard library
    Spark - Spero build/dependency manager. Initial development will be done in Rust
    vs-spero - VS Code extension that adds Spero support


## Current Todo List:

    1) Working on the module/import syntax and semantics
    2) Describing the full grammar
    3) Designing the type system
    4) Deciding on concurrency model
    5) Formalizing language documentation
    6) Start working on the compiler
    7) Planning out the standard library


## Some example programs

    # Hello World
    def main = () -> "Hello World!".println
