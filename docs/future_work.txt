Scrap sheet for tracking ideas for future versions of the language

Allow for "def foo(...) :: T = ..." syntax for defining functions. Translates to "def foo = (...) -> T ...".
  Problem: Where to put "mut" for marking mutable methods
Allow for "def T(...) { ... }" syntax for defining types. Translates to "def T = (...) { ... }"
  Problem: I think ADTs would require the "= <ADT>" syntax to work [Might not though]
Allow for the creation of custom annotations
Think about allowing "3.+ 4" instead of "3.+(4)"
Change Type junction syntax to have CNF precedence levels (ala binary operators)
  Just flips the precedence from and matching first to or matching first
Add in Higher Kinded Types to the language
  Particularly allow for generic fields to be "ignored" through the '_' character
