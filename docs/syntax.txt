Bindings
  A binding is any name that the programmer uses to reference a value
    Bindings are subdivided into three types: Variables, Operators, and Types

  Types are simply indicated by the first character being capitalized
    [A-Z][A-Za-z_]

  Variables are indicated by the first character being lowercase
    [a-z][A-Za-z_]!?

  Operators are pretty much anything that isn't capture by variable/type
