Testing for definition
  The '?' operator can be used to test whether a public member is defined
    For types: <type> ? <name>
    For scope: ... ? <name>

Type Interactions
  All types inherit from the supertype, Type
  [T] <- A type-list
  (T) <- A type tuple (no "->" or "{" so not an arg tuple)

  Check for a method:
    <type> ? <method>
    <type>.hasMethod("<method>")
    <type>.methods.find(m.name == "split")

  Check for signature:
    .? <method> :: <sig>
    :: <sig>
