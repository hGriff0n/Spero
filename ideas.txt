## TODO
Figure out how low-level I want to go
Definately need to determine how to implement references/pointers
##

built-in event loop (ala lever)
    easy to develop concurrency
    main would be a default

compiler raises warnings for every "TODO" in a comment
	or have a "todo" annotation (have both)

Rust-style "unsafe" blocks
